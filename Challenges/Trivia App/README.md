## Trivia app

*By Nicolas Schurmann (Hola mundo) - Developer & youtuber*

"Build a trivia app. When a person enters, they must ask for some information. After that, you will be able to choose a category and then you will have to answer random questions about that topic. When you finish the questions, it should add you to the ranking of the people who have answered and show you the time it took you to answer"
