## Memory game

*By Nicolas Schurmann (Hola mundo) - Developer & youtuber*

"Build a set with an even number of cards face down. Each card has a hidden image or symbol, and there must be only one pair with this symbol/image. When the user clicks on a card, it should be displayed. When two cards have been clicked, and they are the same, they must be left visible for the rest of the game. If they are different, they should be hidden again giving feedback to the user. At the end it should show a classification table with respect to other users."
